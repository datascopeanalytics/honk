For `spectrogram_intro.ipynb` to work you need a few extra dependencies:
* `ilypond` from http://www.fluidsynth.org/
* `abjad` from http://abjad.mbrsi.org/
* `fluidsynth` from http://www.fluidsynth.org/

The file `honk.ipynb` is still a work in progress and many pieces of it will not work except on my local machine. I am currently breaking it apart into several separate modules.
